They appear to be completely different, however 
this may just be due to their nonlinear nature. 
When one inspects the graphs of the two, they are 
very different. The graph of the one from git has 
many different branches at all times. Eggert's version
doesn't have nearly as many branches and is often 
just one branch. When you inspect the branches of 
each, git's has just one branch: master. However,
when you inspect Eggerts, there are several
branches: maint master next seen todo.
